																				Guidelines which

																			</p>

																			<p>Conflict of Interest
																				is a
																				situation/condition
																				that allows PTBA
																				Personnel to take
																				advantage of their
																				position and
																				authority within the
																				Company for
																				personal, family or
																				group interests, so
																				they cannot carry
																				out their mandated
																				tasks objectively
																				and have
																				implications for the
																				Company’s
																				performance and
																				image in the long
																				term. PTBA personnel
																				are obliged to avoid
																				all forms of
																				potential conflicts
																				of interest that
																				could be detrimental
																				to the Company, by
																				freeing themselves
																				from</p>

																			<p>the situation by
																				reporting it to the
